# Polegion Pitch Presentation Guide

## 1. HOOK/OPENING (30 seconds)
*"Imagine a 6th grader staring at angles and polygons in their textbook, completely lost. In the Philippines, geometry is one of the most challenging subjects for elementary students—but what if learning it felt like playing a video game?"*

---

## 2. THE PROBLEM (1 minute)

### Filipino Elementary Students & Geometry Struggles

**Key Statistics & Research:**
- **DepEd Studies (2019-2023)**: Mathematics consistently ranks as one of the lowest-performing subjects in National Achievement Tests, with geometry concepts showing particularly poor comprehension rates
- **TIMSS 2019 Data**: Filipino Grade 4 students scored below international average in geometry and measurement domains
- **Classroom Reality**: Traditional textbook-based geometry teaching lacks visual and interactive elements critical for spatial reasoning development

**Specific Pain Points:**
1. **Abstract Concepts**: Students struggle to visualize 2D and 3D shapes
2. **Limited Engagement**: Passive learning methods fail to maintain student interest
3. **No Practice Feedback**: Students don't know what they're doing wrong until tests
4. **One-Size-Fits-All**: No personalized learning paths for different skill levels
5. **Assessment Anxiety**: High-stakes testing without formative practice opportunities

**Target Demographics:**
- Primary: Grade 6 students (11-12 years old)
- Secondary: Elementary mathematics teachers
- Tertiary: Parents seeking supplemental learning tools
